# Github Workflow

## Overall Structure

There will be a **singular** GitHub repository for the entire team, called 2020-Infinite-Recharge. The repository will be organized with the following branches:

- master
- end_game
- integrated_robot (or whatever we are renaming this to)
- control_wheel
- autonomous
- ball_scorer

## Software Students

Each software team member will have a fork of this main repository on their GitHub accounts. 

```

```

Operating in this forked repository, students will work within the branch they are assigned to.

The students will regularly update their forks with the code from the main GitHub repository. They will regularly update their own repositories, even if they have not completed a feature or something hasn’t been tested.

```

```

When students have completed and tested a feature, they will make a pull request to their assigned branch in the master GitHub project.

## Software Leads

There will be a primary software lead assigned to each branch. This lead has the permissions to approve pull requests to  branches on the frc-team-3341 GitHub project. Software leads, when they are coding, will follow the same workflow as the **Software Students**.  The difference is the additional responsibility of reviewing and eventually accepting pull requests to the main branch in the frc-team-3341 organization project. These software leads will also, once their branch has been tested, be responsible for making pull requests to the master branch.

## Software Managers

These are the VP of Software, President, and Mentors. The managers will review/approve pull requests from the subsystem branches to the master branch. The master branch will be where the most recent stable robot code is located. Even if it doesn’t have all of the features, it’s guaranteed to work at any given point of time.
